\usage{
taf.library(package, messages = FALSE, warnings = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{package}{name of a package found in \verb{boot/library}.}

\item{messages}{whether to show messages when package loads.}

\item{warnings}{whether to show warnings when package loads.}
}
\value{
The names of packages currently installed in the TAF library.
}
\description{
Load and attach package from local TAF library.
}
\note{
The purpose of the TAF library is to retain R packages that are not commonly
used (and not on CRAN), to support long-term reproducibility of TAF analyses.

If a package has dependencies that are also in the TAF library, they will be
loaded in preference of any version that may be installed in the system or
user library. To force the use of a dependency from outside of the TAF
library call \verb{library(package)} prior to the call to \verb{taf.library}.
