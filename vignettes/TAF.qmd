## Introduction

### Objectives

The overarching goal of the Transparent Assessment Framework (TAF) is to support
*open and reproducible* research. To achieve this goal, the following objectives
have guided the design of TAF:

1. Provide a standard workflow structure that is general enough for any analysis
   that can be run from R.

2. Introduce minimal constraints or learning curve, making it easy for a
   beginner to create a new workflow or convert an existing workflow to TAF
   format.

3. Enable reviewers to browse the data, model settings, and results, without
   being experts in R or the specific methods used.

4. Enable anyone to rerun the analysis on another computer and get the same
   results.

5. Require the scientist to describe the data that are used in the analysis and
   where they came from.

6. Invite the scientist to document with scripts how they processed the data
   before feeding them to the model.

7. Invite the scientist to specify which versions of software are used, so the
   original analysis can be rerun at a later time.

### Design

TAF divides a workflow into four steps:

Script     | Purpose
---------- | ---------------------------
`data.R`   | Preprocess data
`model.R`  | Run model
`output.R` | Extract results of interest
`report.R` | Plots and tables for report

These scripts are run sequentially in alphabetical order, and each script reads
from files created in a previous step. Each script

TAF analyses can be full or partial.
